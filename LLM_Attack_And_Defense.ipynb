This dynamic may suggest a degree of normalization\n","or desensitization to the ongoing vulnerability of core IT\n","systems and access points to such attacks within the field\n","[5] [7]. Empirical studies have consistently identified phishing\n","as the preeminent attack vector, with this trend persisting\n","on an annual basis and email security and awareness being\n","estimated at $50-100B in 2022 [36]. Phishing constitutes a\n","significant attack vector, targeting both industry and Depart-\n","ment of Energy laboratories, thereby presenting one of the\n","most extensive attack surfaces [31] [34] [32]. Furthermore,\n","recent industry research conducted by Barracuda, a promi-\n","nent provider of email protection solutions, indicates that in\n","2022, 73% of surveyed organizations experienced a successful\n","ransomware attack, with 69% of these incidents originating\n","through email phishing vectors [10]. The focus of this research\n","is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using these algorithm\n","in both phishing attacks and phishing defenses. The attack\n","vector takes detectable malicious phishing emails and rewrites\n","them through a novel approach that combines LLM automatic\n","output optimization, Reflection, and Beam Search with Top-K\n","selection. The attack maintains the semantic meaning and IOC\n","of the original malicious emails while effectively bypassing\n","LLM-based phishing detection methods and other institutional\n","tools such as ProofPoint and Sublime [42] [47]. This innova-\n","tive phishing attack methodology, using LLMs, enhances the\n","sophistication of phishing email generation, thereby providing\n","a robust framework for testing and improving existing cyber-\n","security defenses.\n","This attack algorithm proposed in this research effectively\n","compromises and circumvents state-of-the-art defensive mech-\n","anisms. Consequently, the defense strategy proposed in this\n","paper demonstrates robustness against such attacks, surpassing\n","the efficacy of existing solutions. By applying the algorithmic\n","methodology to the defensive prompt, incorporating tech-\n","niques such as Beam Search, Reflection, and Top-K selection,\n","an advanced defensive LLM prompt was developed, enhancing\n","defensive capabilities by up to 97%.\n","The Beam Search algorithm iteratively generates new\n","queries related to the original query, thereby enabling an\n","iterative reasoning process [51] [54]. This iterative process\n","is crucial for generating new attack outputs or defensive\n","prompts, depending on the solution employed. However, a\n","straightforward application of Beam Search can result in the\n","loss of IOCs and semantic meaning. To address this, Reflection\n","is utilized to filter through the Beam Search results and identify\n","the most optimal approach. Reflection provides linguistic\n","feedback, which is then used as context for a LLM agent in\n","subsequent iterations [23] [50]. Despite its advantages, the use\n","of vanilla Reflection, even when combined with Beam Search,\n","presents significant challenges when applied to phishing at-\n","tacks or defenses. Reflection can lead to significant deviations\n","in the next round of Beam Search compared to the previous\n","generation. While this variability is beneficial for discovering\n","new paths and global minima, it often results in the removal of\n","malicious content necessary to maintain the malicious intent of\n","a phishing email. In the same way, for defensive prompting,\n","the reflection and beam search lead the prompt outside the\n","bounds necessary, or focused enough, to capture the criticality\n","of reporting an email as malicious. This research overcomes\n","this issue by ensuring that the Reflection phase only trims the\n","beams and provides new direction while preserving the IOCs\n","and semantic meaning. The trimming of each beam is done\n","through novel application of reflection and beam search, that\n","only scores and lightly gives linguistic feedback through the\n","algorithms demonstrated in this paper. This approach allows\n","for the generation of phishing emails with the lowest possible\n","malicious score while retaining their malicious intent and\n","IOCs. Additionally, the defensive algorithm proposed uses\n","this methodology to rewrite defensive prompts, automatically\n","and iteratively increasing defensive measures, allowing for the\n","defense against a private set of real-world APT generated\n","phishing emails.\n","The deliberate utilization of open-source LLMs, such as\n","LLaMA3 [1], in these algorithm underscores the feasibility\n","of conducting large-scale computations without incurring sig-\n","nificant costs [38]. This approach not only demonstrates the\n","accessibility of such methodologies to non-researchers and\n","penetration testers in practical environments but also highlights\n","the capability of executing these tasks using standard, non-\n","specialized hardware. Previous research has proposed defense\n","mechanisms against phishing attacks that depend on extensive\n","computational resources, not practical for in flight analysis of\n","bulk email [22] [16]. In contrast, this approach enables both\n","penetration testers (red team) and incident responders (blue\n","team) to effectively execute and mitigate attacks using readily\n","available and open-source software, and has already been put\n","to the test in a production environment [19]. These algorithm\n","are optimised for big data approaches that allow organizations\n","to implement without significant challenges. This not only\n","demonstrates the potential of large-scale language models in\n","cybersecurity research but also underscores the importance\n","of continuously evolving defense mechanisms to counteract\n","increasingly sophisticated threats [28].\n","An example of this phishing attack generation, which in-\n","volves taking a malicious email and rewriting it in a way that\n","preserves the IOC and semantic meaning, can be seen in Table\n","I. The starting email seen in Table I is flagged as malicious\n","by other LLMs. Taking this email, and applying the attack\n","algorithm, the email is rewritten and is outputted as seen in the\n","table. This email now bypasses all defenses experimented on\n","within this research. While bypassing all defenses, the email\n","also retains the cash prize amount, address and phone number\n","contained within the original email. Extensive experimentation reveals that current state-of-the-\n","art phishing defenses are inadequate against large-scale auto-\n","mated phishing attacks performed by LLMs. The methodology\n","used in this approach demonstrates that this attack generation\n","method can bypass current industry-standard NLP and LLM-\n","based phishing defenses with up to 98% effectiveness.\n","In summary, the contribution to this work is:\n","1) An attack algorithm which takes detectable malicious\n","phishing emails and rewrites them using an innovative\n","LLM-based automatic output optimization technique.\n","2) A defensive algorithm that performs vastly superior to\n","other solutions in this field.\n","\n","Utilizing the algorithms proposed in this research, a tool was\n","developed for use within DOE laboratories. This tool has\n","been successfully deployed and is currently operational in\n","production within a DOE laboratory. [34] [19].\n","This research is organized as follows: Section III reviews re-\n","lated work. Section IV details the methodology and algorithms\n","used for both attack and defense, explaining how the attack\n","algorithm performs against existing phishing defenses and the\n","proposed defensive algorithm. The results show that the defen-\n","sive algorithm significantly outperforms other defenses of this\n","nature. Section V describes the experiments conducted using\n","both the attack and defensive algorithms. The conclusions are\n","presented in Section VI, followed by an appendix."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BbU7Y8v_20Ce"},"source":["## Imports and Configuration"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"aCoxsXSf20Ce","outputId":"9cadee33-437e-4bc9-c8de-f37a48bdd0fd"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[?25lpulling manifest ⠋ \u001b[?25h\u001b[?25lpulling manifest ⠙ \u001b[?25h\u001b[?25lpulling manifest ⠹ \u001b[?25h\u001b[?25lpulling manifest ⠸ \u001b[?25h\u001b[?25lpulling manifest ⠼ \u001b[?25h\u001b[?25lpulling manifest ⠴ \u001b[?25h\u001b[?25lpulling manifest \n","pulling 8eeb52dfb3bb... 100% ▕████████████████▏ 4.7 GB                         \n","pulling 948af2743fc7... 100% ▕████████████████▏ 1.5 KB                         \n","pulling 0ba8f0e314b4... 100% ▕████████████████▏  12 KB                         \n","pulling 56bb8bd477a5... 100% ▕████████████████▏   96 B                         \n","pulling 1a4c3c319823... 100% ▕████████████████▏  485 B                         \n","verifying sha256 digest \n","writing manifest \n","success \u001b[?25h\n"]}],"source":["# pip install all the nessesary imports\n","!pip3 install ollama matplotlib scikit-learn numpy pandas requests sublime-cli\n","\n","\n","# The algorithm uses these imports\n","import ollama\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import string\n","import time\n","import json\n","import sublime\n","import requests\n","import re\n","\n","\n","# Pull the ollama that will be used for this example code\n","# Make sure to have the ollama CLI installed and running (ollama.com)\n","!ollama pull llama3.1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"edn8hg5Z20Cf"},"outputs":[],"source":["## Default parameters\n","MODELS = ['llama3.1']  # Iterate through each of these models...\n","STEALTH_CHECK_LLMS = ['llama3.1']  # Contain the final models used at the very end\n","SCORE_MODEL = 'llama3.1'  # Specify the model used to score the output of the phishing emails during the algorithm\n","FINAL_EMAIL_OUTPUTS = 'LOWEST_EMAIL'  # Return the best option at the end for final scoring\n","NUM_EPOCHS = 1  # Match the number of models; each epoch chooses a new model\n","GENERATION_PROMPTS = 5  # Define the number of emails generated per index in each epoch\n","LOWEST_AIMPOINT = 40  # Set the aimpoint for the generator; generation stops if a score of 40 or lower is reached\n","INDICIE_RANGE_CHECK = 1.3  # Check that the top K scores are within a reasonable range of each other\n","\n","GENERATOR_SYS_PROMPT_1 = f\"Generate a variation of the following instruction while keeping the semantic meaning.

This research\n","proposes two novel algorithm used for phishing attacks and de-\n","fenses. The attack method combines LLM output optimization,\n","Reflection, and Beam Search with Top-K selection to rewrite\n","known phishing emails. The attack algorithm preserves the\n","original malicious intent while evading LLM-based detection\n","systems, NLP, Prior research, and state-of-the-art industry\n","tooling. The findings demonstrate that this attack method\n","significantly enhances the effectiveness of automated phishing\n","campaigns, achieving attack successes up to 98%. Using the\n","same techniques, the defensive algorithm is applied to a defen-\n","sive prompt allowing for defensive capability surpassing the\n","state-of-the-art currently. Furthermore, the defensive algorithm\n","proposed and implemented within DOE laboratories demon-\n","strate robust performance against these attacks, outperform-\n","ing existing solutions and mitigating advanced LLM-based\n","attacks by up to 97% when used within a DOE production\n","environments.
