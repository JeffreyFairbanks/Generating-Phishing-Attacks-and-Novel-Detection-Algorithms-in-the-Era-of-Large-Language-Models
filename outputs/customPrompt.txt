Here's a possible prompt:

"Classify the following email as 'benign' or 'malicious' based on its content and metadata, considering factors such as:

* Sender reputation (is the sender known or verified?)
* Subject line (is it suspiciously generic or attempting to create urgency?)
* Email body (are there suspicious keywords or URLs? Does it ask for sensitive information?)
* Attachment types (are they executable or ZIP files that could potentially contain malware?)
* URLs (do they point to trusted websites or seem phishing-related?)
* Language patterns (does the tone seem overly promotional, urgent, or threatening?)
* Header analysis (is the email's IP address and timestamp suspicious?)

Additionally, consider whether the email is attempting social engineering tactics such as:

* Impersonation (is it pretending to be someone you trust?)
* Baiting (is it trying to lure you into installing malware or revealing sensitive info?)
* Pretexting (does it create a false sense of urgency or context to manipulate you?)

Please provide a classification and explain your reasoning."
