        "feedback": "92  IMPROVEMENT:  To make this prompt even more specific, consider adding more concrete examples of what constitutes \"suspicious\" or \"malicious\" content in each category. For instance, instead of just mentioning that a generic subject line might be suspicious, provide a few examples of specific keywords or phrases that could raise red flags. This will give the model a clearer understanding of what to look for and make it easier to classify emails accurately.",
        "prompt": "Here's a possible prompt:\n\n\"Classify the following email as 'benign' or 'malicious' based on its content and metadata, considering factors such as:\n\n* Sender reputation (is the sender known or verified?)\n* Subject line (is it suspiciously generic or attempting to create urgency?)\n* Email body (are there suspicious keywords or URLs? Does it ask for sensitive information?)\n* Attachment types (are they executable or ZIP files that could potentially contain malware?)\n* URLs (do they point to trusted websites or seem phishing-related?)\n* Language patterns (does the tone seem overly promotional, urgent, or threatening?)\n* Header analysis (is the email's IP address and timestamp suspicious?)\n\nAdditionally, consider whether the email is attempting social engineering tactics such as:\n\n* Impersonation (is it pretending to be someone you trust?)\n* Baiting (is it trying to lure you into installing malware or revealing sensitive info?)\n* Pretexting (does it create a false sense of urgency or context to manipulate you?)\n\nPlease provide a classification and explain your reasoning.\"",
